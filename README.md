__ServerDistance.py__:
ServerDistance.py finds the distance between 
the computer it is being run on and the server
for a website along the path between each 
router that was used to get from the computer 
to the server.

syntax:     python ServerDistance.py [URL] 

The script will iterate through as many addresses
as are inputted.

If no addresses are inputted, it will find the
distance between your computer and a facebook.com
server.

Simple script to keep a player alive through Nightmare
Zone. Depends on the OpenCV and Numpy python libraries
