Alex's Scripts

__ServerDistance.py__
ServerDistance.py finds the distance between 
the computer it is being run on and the server
for a website along the path between each 
router that was used to get from the computer 
to the server.

syntax:     python ServerDistance.py <address.of.website>

The script will iterate through as many addresses
as are inputted.

If no addresses are inputted, it will find the
distance between your computer and a facebook.com
server.

__NMZ.sh__
NMZ stand for nightmare zone.

This script keep's my runescape character
alive in the nightmare zone minigame for 
around three and a half hours. It will run
just fine on any computer with a screen
resolution of at least 1060x710. (because
that is the bottom right corner of my 
farthest click in that direction)
