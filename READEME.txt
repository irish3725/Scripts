Alex's Scripts


__________NMZ.sh___________
NMZ stand for nightmare zone.

This script keep's my runescape character
alive in the nightmare zone minigame for 
around three and a half hours. It will run
just fine on any computer with a screen
resolution of at least 1060x710. (because
that is the bottom right corner of my 
farthest click in that direction)

My first goal for this is to just get the 
essential drinking of overload and absorbtion
potions at the right times and clicking the
prayer orb at the right times and randomizing
it a little bit to make it look less like
a program running it. I also want it to 
shutdown my computer while I am still in the
nightmare zone to log me out of the game.

Later, I would like to allow myself to 
finish the game and log out before shutting
my computer down as well as logging my
the time it was running and logging the 
experience gained per hour and putting it
all in a small log file.
